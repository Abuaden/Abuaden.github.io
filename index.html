       <h1>Abubakar Aden</h1>
       <p>In my role as a Ramp Supervisor at Unifi, I effectively managed baggage handling, employee training, and scheduling while prioritizing safety. As a Sales Associate at Kohl's and Cashier at OfficeMax, I consistently delivered outstanding customer experiences and efficient transactions. With a foundation in graduating from Mayo High School, I'm now enthusiastic about pursuing opportunities that involve software development and customer service.</p>
